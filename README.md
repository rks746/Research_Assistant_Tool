# Research Assistant Tool â€“ AI-powered Summarization & Semantic Search
Personal Project | Python, Hugging Face Transformers, SentenceTransformers, FAISS

Developed an end-to-end research assistant that summarizes academic papers and enables semantic search within uploaded documents.

Used pretrained transformer models (BART/T5) for abstractive summarization to generate concise overviews of research content.

Implemented document chunking and embeddings using SentenceTransformers, indexed with FAISS for efficient, similarity-based search.

Built a user-friendly interface to upload PDFs, view summaries, and retrieve relevant sections through natural language queries.

Improved research workflows by enabling fast navigation through large volumes of technical content.
